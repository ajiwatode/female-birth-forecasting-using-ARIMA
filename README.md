# female-birth-forecasting-using-ARIMA
 ARIMA, which stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, is a powerful time series forecasting algorithm. It explains a given time series based on its own past values, including lags and lagged forecast errors. The goal is to predict future values using historical data.

# Project description: 

The problem is to forecast the daily number of female births in California. The dataset described a time-series of baby births in California over 12 months in 1959, and there are 365 observations.

Try it out with different Time series models and finally choose the best of it after comparison.

# Final Insights

ARIMA is a powerful tool for time series forecasting but requires careful parameter tuning.

Continuous evaluation and comparison with other models ensure robustness.

The process of model selection and validation is iterative and data-driven.
